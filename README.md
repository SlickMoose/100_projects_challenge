# 100 Projects Challenge

This repository aims to expand my teorethical and practical knowledge of programming languages. Basic language used across all projects is Python but along with progress other will be included as well (e.g Javascript, C++).

The repository is created so that each folder corresponds to the project number and each subfolder correspond to the language in which they were written.

## Dependencies

As it is a challenge, only built-in Python standard library will be used.
For Graphical User Interface will be using Tkinter.

If you would like to test or contribute to one of the projects:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MrDominikku/100_projects_challenge
```
